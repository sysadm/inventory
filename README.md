## About Inventory

Inventory is a Ruby on Rails stand-alone multilanguage software for mid-size/large companies to store information about
all hardware in stock. It was created for internal purpose of [Multitel A.S.B.L.](http://www.multitel.be/)
(non-profit organisation) by Jerzy SÅ‚adkowski. Our company just need to have custom but fast and effective web based application
with complete information about any equipment including type, model, serial, date of purchase, warranty, vendor, user etc.

Features
--------

* Easy install and using (autocomplete and ajax autocomplete in forms).
* As a backend author use sqlite for some internal Multitel reason. But you can use any other database which supported by ActiveRecord as well.
* Two way login. You can use your LDAP or standard login/pass authentication (take a look on screenshots section).
* Three roles for authorization. You can be administrator (read/write anything), read only user (read access everywhere), user (read only access to equipment assigned to you).
* Changing user access permissions on the fly.
* Live search. Main goal of this application 'cause you can find the hardware by its sticker number or any other information (user, vendor, serial, model etc) just in few clicks.
* Automatic backup system with versioning. If you change anything in your equipment (modify model/description, delete old one or add new one) next backup of all database to CSV file will be created in background. You always can restore any previous state of your system by rollback to specific version.
* CSV import for massive changes of database.
* Automatic tests with poltergeist or selenium (if you prefer to observe what's going on) to easy support and upgrade application/environment.
